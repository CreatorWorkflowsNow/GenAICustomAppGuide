Purpose of the Application:
The purpose of the application is to be used by a city zoo to track and manage the animal's diets.  "Animal Diet Management".
Key Functionalities:
Zoo members can request a "Diet Change Request."
The request can be assigned to multiple people or teams at once. 
Need approvals for changes. 
The application will also be used to manage diet sheet requests for new or current animals in the zoo.
User Roles Involved if you already know:
It's going to be used by end users at the zoo to make requests: Warehouse Specialist and Warehouse Manager, Nutritionist, and Nutritionist leadership.
Data to be Tracked:
We will need to track the animal's name, date of birth, weight, breed, species, and location in the zoo. The location will be something that is standard across the zoo. The same goes for breed and species.
Integration with Other Systems:
I'm not sure about integrations, but I'm open to some suggestions based on my application.
